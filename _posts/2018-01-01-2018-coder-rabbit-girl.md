excerpt: This is Loris Down, a rabbit girl who codes websites. She was my self-insert character at the time, and this was one of her earlier designs. Her hair and eye colors are based on Rei from the anime series <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. The logo on her shirt is a prototype for a web design business that I wanted to make at the time.
