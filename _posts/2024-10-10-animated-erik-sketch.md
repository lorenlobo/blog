excerpt: "On September 14, 2024, I became obsessed with The Phantom of the Opera. After watching the 2004 and 1989 films, I watched the 1987/1988 animated version, and I succumbed to Erik's charm. Aiden Grennell was my favorite Erik. This one and 1925 are the most accurate to the book, so I had to check those out, too... <a href='https://elilobo.com/art/animated-erik'>Here is the colored version</a>."
