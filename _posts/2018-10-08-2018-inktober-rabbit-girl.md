excerpt: This was my favorite Inktober drawing from 2018. The prompt for Day 8 was "Star". I based it off a photograph of a doll with a rabbit mask. It really spoke to me because it made me think about my female rabbit character that I was creating for my hypothetical video game story. To summarize her story, she is a lovesick murderer hellbent on killing her lover's exes.
